#Text Generation using NLP Algorithms and Models

The purpose of this project is to show how to build a text generator using Natural Language Processing algorithms using the Keras API and TensorFlow. I made a dataset of customer service tweets pulled from Twitter using Twitter's API. A jupyter notebook showing how to do this is in the repo. The purpose of the models are to learn from the tweets and be able to respond to a seed tweet either asking for help or some other customer service option. The models build in complexity and are explained in detail about how to build the models, why layers are chosen, how certain model options affect the text generator. 

The first model is a simple character tokenized RNN with a few LSTM layers.

The second model is word tokenized and uses a similar RNN archeticture
