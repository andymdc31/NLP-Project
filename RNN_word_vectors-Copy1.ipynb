    "The purpose of this notebook is to build on the ideas of the previous character model but to use a word model instead. Using the data set of tweets, the tweets will be tokenized and instead of each character sequence being used to train the model, the sequences will be the tweets themselves providing a more comprehensive text bot. Or at least that is the goal. A few more features are added to the model such as embeddings which I will go into in the appropriate sections. "

While this function is doing roughly the same tokenization process as the  previous notebook it is slightly different. Here the words are being tokenized but then instead of making character sequences, this function makes sequences out of the tweets in an n-gram sequence. You can think of an n-gram as the sequence of N words. A 2-gram sequence would have two words and a 3-gram sequence would have 3 and so on. N-grams are used to assign probabilities to sentences and sequences of words based on relative frequency count approach."

However there was an issue with the Keras tokenizer and the either the encodings or something along those lines. The issue made the tokenizer split every word into characters and used those as the tokens. Even after using a function to go through the file and put it into ascii format, it still would not work. Since this is not what I wanted I found a hacky way to make it work. If instead you read the csv file into an pandas data frame, you can then use the columns of that data frame as a list of the tweets and then tokenize those and for some reason this works. "

    "Several things can be taken away from this model. For starters it takes much less time to train so I was able to go through more epochs and potentially have a better result. Some more fine tuning could be done. But that is always the case with NLP models. I could add more layers, more neurons, etc etc. But in this case I believe that if I remove numbers from the tokens than it will produce more text. And hopefully that text will be better. There is semblance of actual speech though in this text. It isn't just the same sentence over and over again which occurred in the word model. Keras really simplified the process of building this model as well. I would also like to explore GRUs as well as attention in the following models. "
